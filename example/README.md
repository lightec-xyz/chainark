This is a simple example showing case how to use the `chainark` library.

## Understanding the data and the chain structure
Suppose we have a chain structureï¼š

`data0 <- data1 <- data2 <- data3`

Following the rule:

$id_{n+1}$ = SHA256($id_n$ || "chainark example")

Each data is simply composed by below two elements concatenated together `hash || string_literal`, where:

1. `hash` is hash value of 32 bytes, which is the SHA256 hash of its predecessor data;
2. `string literal` is `chainark example`.

Now the `LinkageID` is the `hash` value. In the supplied [data file](./data.txt), the first `hash` is generated by running this command:

`echo 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 | xxd -r -p | openssl sha256 -hex`

It outputs hash value `66687aadf862bd776c8fc18b8e9f8e20089714856ee233b3902a591d0d5f2925`.

Then `data0`, or the first line of the [data file](./data.txt) is simply

`66687aadf862bd776c8fc18b8e9f8e20089714856ee233b3902a591d0d5f2925636861696e61726b206578616d706c65`

with `636861696e61726b206578616d706c65` as the hex encode of `chainark example`.

Going forward we may have the ID corresponding to `data0` from running the command:

`echo 66687aadf862bd776c8fc18b8e9f8e20089714856ee233b3902a591d0d5f2925636861696e61726b206578616d706c65 | xxd -r -p | openssl sha256 -hex`

and its value is `843d12c93f9079e0d63a6101c31ac8a7eda3b78d6c4ea5b63fef0bf3eb91aa85`. This is then the `genesis ID` or `id0`. Usually a genesis ID is publically known and recognized.

Now `data1` becomes `843d12c93f9079e0d63a6101c31ac8a7eda3b78d6c4ea5b63fef0bf3eb91aa85636861696e61726b206578616d706c65`, and we can compute `id1`, and so on.

## The proving task

Now we want to prove that following the above hashing computation rule, a hash value of `ad057c8b077361d9f5673d5faa0bf4f6c5013bb5fb745339042329976637a705` could be computed starting from the data identified by the `genesis ID` of `843d12c93f9079e0d63a6101c31ac8a7eda3b78d6c4ea5b63fef0bf3eb91aa85`.

To do this, we first need to generate the `unit` proofs, that is, we need a ZK-proof from a data item (`hash || "chainark example"`) to an ID (`hash`) for all the IDs from genesis to the one under question. `UnitCircuit` is implemented in the [unit/core/circuit.go]. For demonstration, 4 types unit circuits are defined, each handle 8/4/2/1 hash iteration.  Besides unit circuit definition, a main function in unit/unit.go is defined to generate the unit proofs.

Then we also need to create main functions to output the genesis and recursive proofs. The genesis circuit verifies the first unit proof, building the initial chain structure starting from the chosen genesis ID. The recursive circuit verifies first a genesis proof or a recursive proof, then a unit proof. The proof generated from the recursive circuit could be used to verify the existence of a chain from the genesis ID to the one under question.

## Under the hook

Please refer to the [general doc](../README.md).

## Running the example

### generate verification keys

Note that the fingerprints of all verification keys have been hardcoded in the [example codes](./app_types.go). Usually you don't need to worry about it. But if you have modified some of the circuits, or if you are planning to build your own application based on this example, here are general procedures to follow:

1. Go to the `unit` folder, build the application, run `./unit --setup` to generate proving key and verification key for the unit circuit;
2. Go to the `genesis` folder, build the application, run `./genesis --setup` to generate proving key and verification key for the genesis circuit;
3. Go to the `recursive` folder, build the application, run `./recursive --setup` to generate proving key and verification key for the recursive circuit;


### compute the proofs

Now setup is complete. Run below commands to compute the proof:

1. Go to the `unit` folder, run `./unit_prove.sh`;
2. Go to the `genesis` folder, run `./genesis_prove.sh`;
3. Go to the `recursive` folder, run `./recursive_prove.sh`.

Now you have exactly one proof for each and every id: the genesis id is recognized, its successor is proved with a `unit` proof, the next is proved with a `genesis` proof, and the rest with a corresponding `recursive` proof.

### generate verification keys and compute proofs at once 
```
sh run.sh
```
